# MARC-21 to EAD conversion

Code Repository for metadata conversion from MARC-21 to EAD (Encoding Archival Description)

For more information, please contact claus.zinn@uni-tuebingen.de

# Website

This web service allows you to convert MARC-21 format to EAD.

It makes use of a stylesheet retrieved from http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/xslt

The conversion from MARC-21 to EAD is currently being served at:

```http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/converter/Marc2EAD/ ```

A REST interface is also available. See webpage above.

# Status

The software has no official release yet, but won't change much in the future, given the stylesheet's fixed nature.
